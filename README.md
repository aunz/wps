# wps
Webpack skeleton

```shell
npm init
npm i wps -D
```

This adds webpack & babel (core, loader, preset es2015, stage 0, plugin-transform-runtime) as devDependencies to your app
Diretories `src` and `tool` will also be created
You can edit the skeleton `webpack.config.js` insides the `tool` directory

run `node tool\dev` for development
run `node tool\build` to build for production
